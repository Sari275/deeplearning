# my-deep-learning-projects
Repository for all my Deep Learning (CSEN 342) projects under Prof. Dragos(David) Anastasiu
- Project 1  *Peptide Classification: The objectives of this assignment are the following: *Create feed-forward neural networks and train them using your own codes and frameworks. * Experiment with different feature extraction techniques.  * Think about dealing with imbalanced data.
- Project 2 *  Object Detection: The objectives of this assignment are the following: * Train one or more detection models via transfer learning. * valuate hyperparameter choices and how they affect the learning. * Think about dealing with imbalanced data.
