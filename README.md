- Project 1  *Peptide Classification: The objectives of this assignment are the following: *Create feed-forward neural networks and train them using your own codes and frameworks. * Experiment with different feature extraction techniques.  * Think about dealing with imbalanced data.
- Project 2 *Object Detection: The objectives of this assignment are the following: * Train one or more detection models via transfer learning. * Evaluate hyperparameter choices and how they affect the learning. Use the validation set to validate parameter choices. * Choose the best model, i.e., best classifier + best hyper-parameter choices.
- Project 3  *Audio Classification: The objectives of this assignment are the following: *Experiment with different audio feature extraction techniques. *Create a Deep Learning-based audio clip classifier (RNN or Transformer-based model).
model).  * Think about dealing with imbalanced data.
